# Attendance-system-
Attendance system using face recognition
Tech used:
->tkinter which is a standard GUI library for python
->OpenCV for taking images and for face recognition	wherein Haar cascade  classifier algorithm  is used which is an object detection algorithm used to identify faces in this application.     
numpy , pandas, CSV, datetime ,pillow etc for making excels and displaying live clock on the window and etc.


Commands for installing all required modules:(make sure pip is available with python installation:
->pip install tk-tools
->pip install opencv-contrib-python
->pip install datetime
->pip install pytest-shutil
->pip install python-csv
->pip install numpy
->pip install pillow
->pip install pandas
->pip install times
*For new registrations password 
->TrainingImageLabel folder->psd.txt(1234)                                                                    
->For Admin password - TrainingImageLabel folder------>Admin.txt(G15)

Project Description:
It’s a Python GUI (using tkinter library) integrated attendance system which  will be using face recognition for taking attendance . In this application , We have made an attendance system which will use face recognition for taking attendance. It has been integrated with GUI so that it can be easy for anyone to use it . 
Basically using a protected password students/employees which will be registered and then they will be able to mark their attendance everyday on their own.
Users during their first registration will be asked to take their images and those will be used as training images, so next time whenever that user wants to mark his/her attendance their present image will be compared to the saved images and then attendance will be marked.
If the attendance of a user is already marked and if the user forgot and again tried to mark their attendance then it will show a message that attendance is already marked and hence duplicates can be avoided.
The password which need to be entered will be protected and can only be changed if admin wants to change it through admin password check.


Future scope of the project:
->In these days technology being improved day to day and we are able to see new things everyday. 
->What matters is that how long one application or a device being used.
->So in my opinion as long as education/employment persists the concept of tracking attendance will always have its value.
->The more simpler we make it for the users the more comfortable will be their work. So smart attendance tracking which uses the face recognition is a simple but still comfortable application one can use.
->There will be certainly more features that can be added anytime which will make this application much more comfortable to use and easy to manage.
